        <p>The Department of Information Technology was started functioning in the year 1999, under School of Engineering & Technology, by Bharathidasan University and offered 4 years B.Tech Programme in Information Technology with an annual intake of 60 students. Later in 2006-2007, B.E Programme in Computer Science and Engineering was added with the same intake, and the Department was renamed as Department of Computer Science and Engineering in 2007. It also offered two P.G courses in Software Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering from 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 with an annual intake of 25 in each programme, under self-financing mode. This institute has been converted to a technical university, Anna University, Trichy in 2007 and the annual intake of the U.G courses were doubled to 120 in order to cater the needs of the rural mass. The present AICTE approved annual intake of B.E (CSE) & B.Tech (IT) courses is 120 besides lateral entry for Diploma in engineering students. In 2012-13, another PG course M.E (Mobile and Pervasive Computing Technology) is offered in this department with an intake of 25 students. The students of this department excel in University examinations and brought laurels to the department. For instance, during 2012-13, six students of B.E (CSE), bagged University ranks among the top 50 and 14 students of B.Tech (IT) have obtained University ranks in top 50.During 2013-2014 passed out students.</p>
